ConDroid
==========================

This project is a fork and extension of the Acteve project on concolic execution for Android (https://code.google.com/p/acteve/) [1]

ConDroid performs <i>concolic</i> execution of Android apps - a combination of pure symbolic and concrete execution of a program which has first been described in [2] for C programs. 
The goal of ConDroid is to drive execution of Android app to specific code locations without requiring any manual interaction with the app. This allows to observe "interesting" behavior in a dynamic analysis, such as network traffic or dynamic code loading.

Some details on the extensions have been published in [3].

Getting Started
==========================

#### Prerequisites
* Android SDK
* Z3 solver, including the string extensions from this project

#### Clone 

`git clone https://github.com/JulianSchuette/ConDroid.git`

#### Install Z3-str

Unzip Z3 solver with added supported for String operations (equals, concat, etc.) 

```
unzip Z3-str_20140720.zip /opt/
mv /opt/Z3-str_20140720 /opt/z3
```

#### Set up configuration

`mv config.properties.sample config.properties`

#### Set up eclipse

* Import project into eclipse

#### Launch

* Launch an android emulator
* Launch run configuration from eclipse
The app under test is given as argument to the program
